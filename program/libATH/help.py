    _formatPitch = 'Pitches may be specified by letter name (psName), pitch space (psReal), pitch class, MIDI note number, or frequency. Pitch letter names may be specified as follows: a sharp is represented as "#"; a flat is represented as "$"; a quarter sharp is represented as "~"; multiple sharps, quarter sharps, and flats are valid. Octave numbers (where middle-C is C4) can be used with pitch letter names to provide register. Pitch space values (as well as pitch class) place C4 at 0.0. MIDI note numbers place C4 at 60. Numerical representations may encode microtones with additional decimal places. MIDI note-numbers and frequency values must contain the appropriate unit as a string ("m" or "hz").'
    
    _formatSieve = 'Xenakis sieves are entered using logic constructions of residual classes. Residual classes are specified by a modulus and shift, where modulus 3 at shift 1 is notated 3@1. Logical operations are notated with "&" (and), "|" (or), "^" (symmetric difference), and "-" (complementation). Residual classes and logical operators may be nested and grouped by use of braces ({}). Complementation can be applied to a single residual class or a group of residual classes. For example: -{7@0|{-5@2&-4@3}}. When entering a sieve as a pitch set, the logic string may be followed by two comma-separated pitch notations for register bounds. For example "3@2|4, c1, c4" will take the sieve between c1 and c4.'
    _formatPulse = 'Pulses represent a duration value derived from ratio and a beat-duration. Beat duration is always obtained from a Texture. Pulses are noted as a list of three values: a divisor, a multiplier, and an accent. The divisor and multiplier must be positive integers greater than zero. Accent values must be between 0 and 1, where 0 is a measured silence and 1 is a fully sounding event. Accent values my alternatively be notated as + (for 1) and o (for 0). If a beat of a given duration is equal to a quarter note, a Pulse of (1,1,1) is a quarter note, equal in duration to a beat. A Pulse of (2,1,0) is an eighth-note rest: the beat is divided by two and then multiplied by one; the final zero designates a rest. A Pulse of (4,3,1) is a dotted eight note: the beat is divided by four (a sixteenth note) and then multiplied by three; the final one designates a sounding event. A Rhythm is designated as list of Pulses. For example: ((4,2,1), (4,2,1), (4,3,1)).'
    
    _formatMarkov = 'Markov transition strings are entered using symbolic definitions and incomplete n-order weight specifications. The complete transition string consists of two parts: symbol definition and weights. Symbols are defined with alphabetic variable names, such as "a" or "b"; symbols may be numbers, strings, or other objects. Key and value pairs are notated as such: name{symbol}. Weights may be give in integers or floating point values. All transitions not specified are assumed to have equal weights. Weights are specified with key and value pairs notated as such: transition{name=weight | name=weight}. The ":" character is used as the zero-order weight key. Higher order weight keys are specified using the defined variable names separated by ":" characters. Weight values are given with the variable name followed by an "=" and the desired weight. Multiple weights are separated by the "|" character. All weights not specified, within a defined transition, are assumed to be zero. For example, the following string defines three variable names for the values .2, 5, and 8 and provides a zero order weight for b at 50%, a at 25%, and c at 25%: a{.2}b{5}c{8} :{a=1|b=2|c=1}. N-order weights can be included in a transition string. Thus, the following string adds first and second order weights to the same symbol definitions: a{.2}b{5}c{8} :{a=1|b=2|c=1} a:{c=2|a=1} c:{b=1} a:a:{a=3|b=9} c:b:{a=2|b=7|c=4}. For greater generality, weight keys may employ limited single-operator regular expressions within transitions. Operators permitted are "*" (to match all names), "-" (to not match a single name), and "|" (to match any number of names). For example, a:*:{a=3|b=9} will match "a" followed by any name; a:-b:{a=3|b=9} will match "a" followed by any name that is not "b"; a:b|c:{a=3|b=9} will match "a" followed by either "b" or "c".'
